This the fifth blogging platform i am exploring after having tried out multiple flavours of Wordpress, Drupal  Medium , Ghost and jekyll. This is my final platform of choice . I am committed to not exploring any other platform for the near future. 

While i did move to a new platform. I also decided to revisit the kind of post i do in my blog.   This new theme for my blog makes my existing content in old platform redundant.   

The primary focus of all my writings is to learn. I strive to write about everything i learn on a daily basis.  Anything i cannot articulate and explain in a simple language is something i do not understand well. 

I Have categorised them into two section: Blog & Books.
Blogs are items which i start writing on without a single point of reference. All my learnings ( and hence writings) are based on numerous source and inspiration. These need not be original , however this cannot be attributed to a single source or theory or idea.
Books is something i use to explain my own-understanding and take away from a single source of information. The source may be books, articles, E learning course, videos etc. I tag all of them into the category of books.
Beside the two major categories : Blog and Book.  I use the following sub tags to represent the interest area in which i have written the articles.

The interest areas for now are: #leadership, #productivity , #productManagement and #technology.
